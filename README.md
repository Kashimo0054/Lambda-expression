# Lambda-expression

Types of interface 
1) regular interface - A interface that has 2 or more methods

2) Functional interface -A functional interface is an interface with just one abstract method. These are used in functional programming, especially with lambda expressions and the java.util.function package.

3) Markerinterface - A marker interface is an interface that doesn't declare any methods. It "marks" a class with a specific property, and it’s typically used for metadata or indicating some special behavior.
It provides no functionality on its own but may be used to signal to the Java runtime or other components that the implementing class has some special property.
Examples: Serializable, Cloneable, Remote.

An anonymous inner class in Java is a class that is declared and instantiated in a single expression, without giving it a name. It is typically used to extend a class or implement an interface on the fly, making the code more concise.

Lambda : Lambda expressions allow you to eliminate the need for creating boilerplate code, like anonymous classes, when passing behavior to methods or APIs.
